# Student Performance Predictor using ML

## Overview

This project predicts students' math scores based on demographic and academic features like gender, parental education, reading and writing scores. It demonstrates basic machine learning with real-world data.

We trained and compared three models — Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest — and selected the best performing one.

## Features

- Cleaned and visualized the dataset
- Preprocessed categorical features using Label Encoding
- Built and evaluated multiple models
- Chose Linear Regression as the final model based on R² and MAE scores

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (ML)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Output

- Best Model: Linear Regression  
- MAE: 4.13  
- R² Score: 0.88
